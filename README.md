# Analyzing Olympic Data with Pandas and Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data related to the Olympics and the medals won by athletes using the Pandas library. Additionally, a basic linear regression model is developed to predict the number of medals based on various features. The analysis and model development are conducted in a Jupyter notebook using Python.

## Project Structure

- `Olympic_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Python Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about Olympic athletes and the medals they have won. The data includes various features such as the athlete's name, country, sport, event, and the number of medals won.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository or download the `graphs-regresion-model.ipynb` file.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `graphs-regresion-model.ipynb` file and open it.
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

## Results

The linear regression model provides predictions for the number of medals won by athletes based on the input features. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of the Pandas library for data analysis and the development of a basic linear regression model to predict the number of medals won by athletes. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide, from data exploration and preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
